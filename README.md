No contracts will be defined - everything is already deployed on chain.

What we will do:
0. Swap our ETH for WETH
1. Deposit some ETH (WETH) on AAVE
2. Borrow some assets using ETH as collateral
3. Repay the loan
4. Withdraw the deposited ETH

We can work with Paraswap, Uniswap and other protocols too.

Integration tests on Kovan.
Unit tests on mainnet-fork (since we won't use oracles).
